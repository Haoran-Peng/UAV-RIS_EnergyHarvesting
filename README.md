# Energy Harvesting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for UAV Based on Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning
## Introduction
- This repository is the implementation of "Energy Harvesting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for UAV Based on Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning".
- This study proposed a dual (time and spcace)-domain energy harvesting (EH) approach to maximize EH efficiency of the UAVâ€”RIS system by jointly optimizing the RIS phase shifts vector, the RIS scheduling martix, the length of energy harvesting phase, and the transmit power. 
- For the UAV trajectory design, we considered the density-aware and Fermat point-based algorithms.
- The implementation of DDPG and TD3 using [Stable-Baseline3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
- The implementation of SD3 is based on Dr. Pan's research: [Softmax Deep Double Deterministic Policy Gradients](https://github.com/ling-pan/SD3).

## Usage
#### Descriptions of folders
- The folder "XXXX-MultiUT-Time" is the source code for the time-domain EH scheme in the multiple user scenario.
- The folder "XXXX-MultiUT-Two" is the source code for the two-domain (Time and Space) EH scheme in the multiple user scenario.
- The folder "XXXX-SingleUT-Time" is the source code for the time-domain EH scheme in the single user scenario.
- The folder "XXXX-SingleUT-Two" is the source code for the two-domain (Time and Space) EH scheme in the single user scenario.
- The folder "CreateData" is the source code for generating dataset of trajectories files for users and the UAV.

#### Descriptions of files
- For the Exhaustive Algorithm, the communication environment is impletemented in 'ARIS_ENV.py'.
- For DRL-based algorithms, the communication environment is impletemented in 'gym_foo/envs/foo_env.py'.
- You can change the dataset and the scenario in 'gym_foo/envs/foo_env.py'.

#### Training phase
1. In the main.py, the switch of "Train" must be 'True' such as
```
14 Train = True # True for tranining, and False for testing.
```
2. python main.py

#### Testing phase
1. In the main.py, the switch of "Train" must be 'False' such as
```
14 Train = False # True for tranining, and False for testing.
```
2. python main.py
3. The harvest energy of each step and overall steps are saved in 'Test_Rewards_Records.csv' and 'Total_Reward_Test.txt', respectively.

#### The EH efficiency
The EH efficiency for each step can be calculated by:
```
 reward of each step / 0.02275827153828275
```
